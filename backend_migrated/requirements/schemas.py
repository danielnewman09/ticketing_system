"""Pydantic schemas for requirements models.

The decompose agent produces a flat list of codegraph node dicts —
the same format that ``LayerGraph.deserialize()`` consumes.  No
intermediate nested transformation is needed; the LLM output goes
directly to ``LayerGraph.deserialize()`` with only scaffold node
materialization as a post-step.

Schema structure::

    DecomposedRequirementSchema
      ├─ description: str   (HLR description, for context)
      └─ nodes: list[dict]   (flat list of codegraph node dicts)

Each node dict has ``type``, node-specific properties, and an
``edges`` array with standard codegraph edge refs::

    {"relation_type": "LEFT_OPERAND", "target_uid": "Engine.result", "target_type": "AttributeNode"}

The LLM generates ``refid`` values for verification nodes (LLR,
VerificationMethod, Condition, Action) and uses them as
``target_uid`` in COMPOSES edges.  Typed edges (LEFT_OPERAND,
RIGHT_OPERAND, CALLEE, CALLER) use notional references (e.g.
``"Engine.result"``, ``"30"``) as ``target_uid`` — scaffold nodes
for these targets are materialized during persistence.
