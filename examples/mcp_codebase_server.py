MCP Neo4j Codebase Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides codebase navigation
using the Neo4j graph database populated by doxygen_to_neo4j.py.

Provides the same tool surface as mcp_codebase_server.py (SQLite) but
leverages graph traversals for relationship-heavy queries (call chains,
inheritance hierarchies, transitive dependencies).

Usage:
    python mcp_neo4j_codebase_server.py [options]

Environment variables:
    NEO4J_URI       Bolt URI       (default: bolt://localhost:7687)
    NEO4J_USER      Username       (default: neo4j)
    NEO4J_PASSWORD  Password       (default: msd-local-dev)
    NEO4J_DATABASE  Database name  (default: neo4j)

Tools provided:
    - search_symbols: Full-text search across all symbols
    - find_class: Find a class/struct by name
    - find_function: Find a function by name
    - get_class_hierarchy: Get inheritance hierarchy for a class
    - get_callers: Find all functions that call a given function
    - get_callees: Find all functions called by a given function
    - get_file_symbols: List all symbols defined in a file
    - get_includes: Get include dependencies for a file
    - get_class_members: Get all members of a class
    - get_function_parameters: Get parameters for a function
    - search_documentation: Full-text search in documentation
    - get_statistics: Get database statistics
    - list_namespaces: List all namespaces
    - list_classes: List all classes
